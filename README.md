# Moon_Classification_Exercise_Udacity
An exercise to define a custom neural network with Pytorch for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. Codes are built to run with Amazon Sagemaker. The task here is to classify "moon data," which is 2-dimensional data whose classes are distributed to look a bit like moons in 2D space.
